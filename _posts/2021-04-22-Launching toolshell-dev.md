---

I am a person who is used to having my tools close to me. Specially when you are in a troubleshooting session, having the right tools for the right job makes problem solving very easy. I compare this to driving a car not knowing your hands are turning the steering wheel. 
This can happen when you are so used to driving that the wheel becomes an extension of your body. 

Based on my need for having a bag of familiar tools when installing/configuration of any cloud software and/or troubleshooting an issue, I started putting together this collection of tools. This included a need for an easy to use editor that has a consistent interface across platforms. 
### This is the genesis of [toolshell](http://www.toolshell.dev). 

The initial effort is to build a docker image that one can quickly install and start diving right into the problem solving. 
Please provide any feedback on the github repo for this project.
