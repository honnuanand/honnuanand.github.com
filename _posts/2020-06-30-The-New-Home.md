summary: Moving to the New Home
---

I have been dabbling with moving my web presense to a more long term home. Jekyll based home on GitHub Pages. Thank you Github for this amazing service and feature that makes it easy to blog and maintain some web content. 

Using github pages was a simple goal. When I started using the themes and tried to leapfrog into using a more sophisticated site always lead me to roadblocks. I decided to go back to the basics and started using Jykill from scratch. Here I am with the minima theme and some initial entries.  

I hope to be more regular on journaling my Technology discoveries, exploration and learnings. I want to credit a recent blog by Richard Seroter on the habit of blogging and building content slowly. This is also not only about building content but getting into the habit of story telling and journaling.

Happy Reading. Please feel free to send me some feedback on your thoughts about my thoughts :) .
